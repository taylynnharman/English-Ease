# Overview

We Created an English Language Learning App. We Wanted the App to useful to people regardless of what language they currently know. To do this we used pictures to make it applicable to all users. Our App is Menu driven. Our home screen Holds links to each of our induvial modules (Food, Numbers, Animalsâ€¦. etc). Each module with the exception of the hang man module uses flashcards That display an image on one side and text on the other.
